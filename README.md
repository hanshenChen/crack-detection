# crack-detection

This is an implementation of deepcrack+SWM, unet+SWM on Python 3,Keras,and TensorFlow.
For the details of the work, the readers can refer to the paper "Improving the Efficiency of Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Pixel-level Crack Detection"

## Requirements
- Tensorflow-1.13.2
- Keras-2.2.4

## Test
Crack detection (Test code) was implemented with tf.keras and eager execution
